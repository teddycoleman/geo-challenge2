# README

In this repository is my geocoder challenge. I used ruby on rails to create a very simple website
that allows the user to enter an address and find the nearest store based on seed data.  For the 
challenge, I used the google maps api with the google places and geometry libraries. 

To run the sample: 
1- clone the repo
2- run "rails s" to start the server
3- in the website, type in your address in the location box and select the location to trigger the calculations
